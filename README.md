# ðŸ§® Rebate Calculator

You have a pre-paid debit card. The card can be topped up, and the money can be spent at retailers offering cashback on any purchases. The rebate is credited to the card in the form of cashback at the end of each month.

This calculator helps determine whether it would be cost-effective to make any given purchase using the pre-paid card.
